# Follow the instructions in this part of the project. Define and flesh out your function below, which should accept a dictionary as an argument when called, and return a string of the info in that book-dictionary in a user-friendly readable format.

# Code below

def getBookInfo(my_book):
    print(f"The title of my book is {my_book['title']}. It was written by {my_book['author']} in the year {my_book['year']}. It was rated {my_book['rating']} out of 5. It is {my_book['pages']} pages long.")


# Once you are finished with that function, create several more functions which return individual pieces of information from the book.

# Code below


# Finally, create at least three new functions that might be useful as we expand our home library app. Perhaps think of a way you could accept additional arguments when the function is called? Also, imagine you have a list filled with dictionaries like above.
